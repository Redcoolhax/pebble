The URI scheme you inputted is not supported.

For example, if you entered:
"github.com/Redcoolhax"

Then the version with a proper URI scheme would actually be:
"https://github.com/Redcoolhax"

If you're testing a server with localhost, then the same applies. 
This wouldn't work:
"localhost:8000"
So you'd have to enter this instead:
"http://localhost:8000"
