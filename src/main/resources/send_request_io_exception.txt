An IOException has occured while attempting to send the HTTP request or receive the response. 
Please take a look at the stack trace below to determine the cause.

- An EOFException usually occurs by chance, particularly with larger responses. 
Trying to send the request again may solve the issue.
- A ConnectException means that a connection couldn't be established. 
This could be because the server isn't active, or took too long to respond. 
If an IP address and port are being used, it could also be because one or 
both of them are incorrect. It's also possible that a firewall may be 
blocking the connection.

If none of the above descriptions fit the situation, or if you are 
experiencing a different kind of Exception entirely, please file a 
bug report on the project's repository.
